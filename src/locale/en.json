    "faq1Q": "How do I choose the right food for my pet?",
    "faq1A": "Choosing the right food depends on your pet's age, size, breed, and health needs. Look for products that meet AAFCO standards and contain high-quality ingredients. Puppies and kittens need food formulated for growth, while senior pets benefit from formulas that support aging joints and organs. If your pet has specific health concerns, consult with your veterinarian for personalized recommendations.",
    "faq2Q": " What is your return and exchange policy?",
    "faq2A": "We accept returns and exchanges within 30 days of purchase with a valid receipt. Unopened food and treats can be returned for a full refund. Opened consumables cannot be returned for health and safety reasons. For toys and accessories, items must be in original condition with packaging. Defective products can be exchanged or refunded at any time. Please contact our customer service team for assistance with returns.",
    "faq3Q": "Do you offer pet adoption services?",
    "faq3A": "While we don't directly handle pet adoptions, we partner with local animal shelters and rescue organizations to host adoption events throughout the year. We can provide information about reputable adoption centers in your area and offer starter kits for new pet parents. We believe in supporting rescue efforts and encourage adoption over purchasing from breeders whenever possible.",
